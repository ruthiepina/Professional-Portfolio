## About The Project

The motivation for this project was to be able to practice and implement what the Module 02: Advanced CSS taught me. I
built from original code to showcase my skills using flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This deployed web app
will set me up for future success in career search.

## User Story

-  AS AN employer
-  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
-  SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

-  GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
-  WHEN I load their portfolio
-  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their
   work, and how to contact them
-  WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
-  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-  WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
-  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
-  WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
-  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-  WHEN I click on the images of the applications
-  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
-  WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
-  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Problems Solved

-  Implementing media queries in my style sheet allowed my page to look pretty and stay responsive with various screen
   sizes. A big part of this work flow was making sure to discard any redundant code between my general styling and my
   media query styling.

-  Began with mobile-first design, then added styling and structure for bigger screen design.

-  Began my work and structuring my html file in nonsemantic, had to go back and format to semantic html.

-  making my avatar meet accessibility standards by adding alt attributes.

-  properly commented and consolidated css style selectors and properties.
