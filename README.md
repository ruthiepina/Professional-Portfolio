## About The Project

The motivation for this project was to be able to practice and implement what the Module 02: Advanced CSS taught me. I built from original code to showcase my skills using flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This deployed web app will set me up for future success in career search.

## User Story

- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Problems Solved 

- Implementing media queries in my style sheet allowed my page to look pretty and stay responsive with various screen sizes. A big part of this work flow was making sure to discard any redundant code between my general styling and my media query styling. 

- Began with mobile-first design, then added styling and structure for bigger screen design. 

- Began my work and structuring my html file in nonsemantic, had to go back and format to semantic html.

- making my avatar meet accessibility standards by adding alt attributes.

- properly commented and consolidated css style selectors and properties.
